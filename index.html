            <strong>Linux</strong> is a family of open source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an
            operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds. Linux is typically packaged
            in a Linux distribution.
            Distributions include the Linux kernel and supporting system software and libraries, many of which are
            provided by the GNU Project. Many Linux distributions use the word "Linux" in their name, but the Free
            Software Foundation uses the name GNU/Linux to emphasize the importance of GNU software, causing some
            controversy.
            Popular Linux distributions include Debian, Fedora, and Ubuntu. Commercial distributions include Red Hat
            Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system
            such as X11 or Wayland, and a desktop environment such as GNOME or KDE Plasma. Distributions intended for
            servers may omit graphics altogether, or include a solution stack such as LAMP. Because Linux is freely
            redistributable, anyone may create a distribution for any purpose.
            Linux was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture, but has since
            been ported to more platforms than any other operating system. Linux is the leading operating system on
            servers and other big iron systems such as mainframe computers, and the only OS used on TOP500
            supercomputers (since November 2017, having gradually eliminated all competitors). It is used by around 2.3
            percent of desktop computers. The Chromebook, which runs the Linux kernel-based Chrome OS, dominates the US
            K–12 education market and represents nearly 20 percent of sub-$300 notebook sales in the US.
            Linux also runs on embedded systems, i.e. devices whose operating system is typically built into the
            firmware and is highly tailored to the system. This includes routers, automation controls, televisions,
            digital video recorders, video game consoles, and smartwatches. Many smartphones and tablet computers run
            Android and other Linux derivatives. Because of the dominance of Android on smartphones, Linux has the
            largest installed base of all general-purpose operating systems.
            Linux is one of the most prominent examples of free and open-source software collaboration. The source code
            may be used, modified and distributed—commercially or non-commercially—by anyone under the terms of its
            respective licenses, such as the GNU General Public License.

          <h3>Precursors</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Linus Torvalds</strong>, principal author of the Linux kernel. The Unix operating system was
            conceived and implemented in 1969, at AT&T's Bell Laboratories in the United States by Ken Thompson, Dennis
            Ritchie, Douglas McIlroy, and Joe Ossanna. First released in 1971, Unix was written entirely in assembly
            language, as was common practice at the time. In 1973 in a key, pioneering approach, it was rewritten in the
            C programming language by Dennis Ritchie (with the exception of some hardware and I/O routines). The
            availability of a high-level language implementation of Unix made its porting to different computer
            platforms easier.
            Due to an earlier antitrust case forbidding it from entering the computer business, AT&T was required to
            license the operating system's source code to anyone who asked. As a result, Unix grew quickly and became
            widely adopted by academic institutions and businesses. In 1984, AT&T divested itself of Bell Labs; freed of
            the legal obligation requiring free licensing, Bell Labs began selling Unix as a proprietary product, where
            users were not legally allowed to modify Unix. The GNU Project, started in 1983 by Richard Stallman, had the
            goal of creating a "complete Unix-compatible software system" composed entirely of free software. Work began
            in 1984. Later, in 1985, Stallman started the Free Software Foundation and wrote the GNU General Public
            License (GNU GPL) in 1989. By the early 1990s, many of the programs required in an operating system (such as
            libraries, compilers, text editors, a Unix shell, and a windowing system) were completed, although low-level
            elements such as device drivers, daemons, and the kernel, called GNU/Hurd, were stalled and incomplete.
            Linus Torvalds has stated that if the GNU kernel had been available at the time (1991), he would not have
            decided to write his own. Although not released until 1992, due to legal complications, development of
            386BSD, from which NetBSD, OpenBSD and FreeBSD descended, predated that of Linux. Torvalds has also stated
            that if 386BSD had been available at the time, he probably would not have created Linux.
            MINIX was created by Andrew S. Tanenbaum, a computer science professor, and released in 1987 as a minimal
            Unix-like operating system targeted at students and others who wanted to learn the operating system
            principles. Although the complete source code of MINIX was freely available, the licensing terms prevented
            it from being free software until the licensing changed in April 2000.
          </p>

          <h3>Creation</h3>
          <p>
            In 1991, while attending the University of Helsinki, Torvalds became curious about operating systems.
            Frustrated by the licensing of MINIX, which at the time limited it to educational use only, he began to work
            on his own operating system kernel, which eventually became the Linux kernel.
            Torvalds began the development of the Linux kernel on MINIX and applications written for MINIX were also
            used on Linux. Later, Linux matured and further Linux kernel development took place on Linux systems. GNU
            applications also replaced all MINIX components, because it was advantageous to use the freely available
            code from the GNU Project with the fledgling operating system; code licensed under the GNU GPL can be reused
            in other computer programs as long as they also are released under the same or a compatible license.
            Torvalds initiated a switch from his original license, which prohibited commercial redistribution, to the
            GNU GPL. Developers worked to integrate GNU components with the Linux kernel, making a fully functional and
            free operating system.

          <p>
            <strong>The GNU Project</strong> is a free software, mass collaboration project that Richard Stallman
            announced on September 27, 1983. Its goal is to give computer users freedom and control in their use of
            their computers and computing devices by collaboratively developing and publishing software that gives
            everyone the rights to freely run the software, copy and distribute it, study it, and modify it. GNU
            software grants these rights in its license.
            In order to ensure that the entire software of a computer grants its users all freedom rights (use, share,
            study, modify), even the most fundamental and important part, the operating system (including all its
            numerous utility programs) needed to be free software. According to its manifesto, the founding goal of the
            project was to build a free operating system, and if possible, "everything useful that normally comes with a
            Unix system so that one could get along without any software that is not free." Stallman decided to call
            this operating system GNU (a recursive acronym meaning "GNU's not Unix!"), basing its design on that of
            Unix, a proprietary operating system. Development was initiated in January 1984. In 1991, the Linux kernel
            appeared, developed outside the GNU project by Linus Torvalds, and in December 1992 it was made available
            under version 2 of the GNU General Public License. Combined with the operating system utilities already
            developed by the GNU project, it allowed for the first operating system that was free software, commonly
            known as Linux.
            The project's current work includes software development, awareness building, political campaigning and
            sharing of the new material.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Origins
              When the GNU project first started they had an Emacs text editor with Lisp for writing editor commands, a
              source level debugger, a yacc-compatible parser generator, and a linker". The GNU system required its own
              C compiler and tools to be free software, so these also had to be developed. By June 1987, the project had
              accumulated and developed free software for an assembler, an almost finished portable optimizing C
              compiler (GCC), an editor (GNU Emacs), and various Unix utilities . They had an initial kernel that needed
              more updates.
              Once the kernel and the compiler were finished, GNU was able to be used for program development. The main
              goal was to create many other applications to be like the Unix system. GNU was able to run Unix programs
              but was not identical to it. GNU incorporated longer file names, file version numbers, and a crashproof
              file system. The GNU Manifesto was written to gain support and participation from others for the project.
              Programmers were encouraged to take part in any aspect of the project that interested them. People could
              donate funds, computer parts, or even their own time to write code and programs for the project.
              The origins and development of most aspects of the GNU Project (and free software in general) are shared
              in a detailed narrative in the Emacs help system. (C-h g runs the Emacs editor command
              describe-gnu-project.) It is the same detailed history as at their web site.
            </li>

            <li>
              GNU Manifesto
              The GNU Manifesto was written by Richard Stallman to gain support and participation in the GNU Project. In
              the GNU Manifesto, Stallman listed four freedoms essential to software users: freedom to run a program for
              any purpose, freedom to study the mechanics of the program and modify it, freedom to redistribute copies,
              and freedom to improve and change modified versions for public use.[12][13] To implement these freedoms,
              users needed full access to code. To ensure code remained free and provide it to the public, Stallman
              created the GNU General Public License (GPL), which allowed software and the future generations of code
              derived from it to remain free for public use.
            </li>

            <li>
              Philosophy and activism
              Although most of the GNU Project's output is technical in nature, it was launched as a social, ethical,
              and political initiative. As well as producing software and licenses, the GNU Project has published a
              number of writings, the majority of which were authored by Richard Stallman.
            </li>

            <li>
              Free software
              The GNU project uses software that is free for users to copy, edit, and distribute. It is free in the
              sense that users can change the software to fit individual needs. The way programmers obtain the free
              software depends on where they get it. The software could be provided to the programmer from friends or
              over the Internet, or the company a programmer works for may purchase the software. ncurses is a library
              of the GNU Project

            <strong>Dragora GNU/Linux-Libre</strong> is an Argentine Linux distribution written from scratch sharing
            some similarities with Slackware. It has a simple packaging system that allows installing, removing,
            upgrading and creating packages, although the system may be challenging to new users. As it only packages
            free software and uses the Linux-libre kernel, the Free Software Foundation endorses Dragora. Dragora is
            considered to be based on the "Keep it simple, stupid" (KISS) principle, believed by the authors to be a
            strength. Dragora can be downloaded from the web site or bought on CD.
            Since Dragora 2 the init system Runit is used.

        <article>
          <p>
            <strong>Debian</strong> also known as Debian GNU/Linux, is a Linux distribution composed of free and
            open-source software, developed by the community-supported Debian Project, which was established by Ian
            Murdock on August 16, 1993. The first version, Debian 0.01, was released on September 15, 1993, and the
            first stable version, 1.1, was released on June 17, 1996. The Debian Stable branch is the most popular
            edition for personal computers and servers, and is the basis for many other distributions.

            Debian is one of the oldest operating systems based on the Linux kernel. The project is coordinated over the
            Internet by a team of volunteers guided by the Debian Project Leader and three foundational documents: the
            Debian Social Contract, the Debian Constitution, and the Debian Free Software Guidelines. New distributions
            are updated continually, and the next candidate is released after a time-based freeze.

            Since its founding, Debian has been developed openly and distributed freely according to the principles of
            the GNU Project. Because of this, the Free Software Foundation sponsored the project from November 1994 to
            November 1995. When the sponsorship ended, the Debian Project formed the nonprofit organization Software in
            the Public Interest to continue financially supporting development.
          </p>
          <h3>Installation</h3>
          <p>
            Debian offers DVD and CD images for installation that can be downloaded using BitTorrent or jigdo. Physical
            discs can also be bought from retailers. The full sets are made up of several discs (the amd64 port consists
            of 13 DVDs or 84 CDs), but only the first disc is required for installation, as the installer can retrieve
            software not contained in the first disc image from online repositories.
            Debian offers different network installation methods. A minimal install of Debian is available via the
            netinst CD, whereby Debian is installed with just a base and later added software can be downloaded from the
            Internet. Another option is to boot the installer from the network.
            Installation images are hybrid on some architectures and can be used to create a bootable USB drive (Live
            USB).[30]
            The default bootstrap loader is GNU GRUB version 2, though the package name is simply grub, while version 1
            was renamed to grub-legacy. This conflicts with e.g. Fedora, where grub version 2 is named grub2.
            The default desktop may be chosen from the DVD boot menu among GNOME, KDE Plasma, Xfce and LXDE, and from
            special disc 1 CDs.
          </p>

          <h3>Live images</h3>
          <p>
            Debian releases live install images for CDs, DVDs and USB thumb drives, for IA-32 and x86-64 architectures,
            and with a choice of desktop environments. These Debian Live images allow users to boot from removable media
            and run Debian without affecting the contents of their computer.
            A full install of Debian to the computer's hard drive can be initiated from the live image environment.
            Personalized images can be built with the live-build tool for discs, USB drives and for network booting
            purposes.
          </p>

          <h3>Developers</h3>
          <p>
            The Debian Project has an influx of applicants wishing to become developers. These applicants must undergo a
            vetting process which establishes their identity, motivation, understanding of the project's principles, and
            technical competence. This process has become much harder throughout the years.
            Debian developers join the project for many reasons. Some that have been cited include:
            Debian is their main operating system and they want to promote Debian.
            To improve the support for their favorite technology
            They are involved with a Debian derivative
            A desire to contribute back to the free-software community
            To make their Debian maintenance work easier
            Debian developers may resign their positions at any time or, when deemed necessary, they can be expelled.
            Those who follow the retiring protocol are granted the "emeritus" status and they may regain their
            membership through a shortened new member process.
            Each software package has a maintainer that may be either one person or a team of Debian developers and
            non-developer maintainers. The maintainer keeps track of upstream releases, and ensures that the package
            coheres with the rest of the distribution and meets the standards of quality of Debian. Packages may include
            modifications introduced by Debian to achieve compliance with Debian Policy, even to fix non-Debian specific
            bugs, although coordination with upstream developers is advised.
            The maintainer releases a new version by uploading the package to the "incoming" system, which verifies the
            integrity of the packages and their digital signatures. If the package is found to be valid, it is installed
            in the package archive into an area called the "pool" and distributed every day to hundreds of mirrors
            worldwide. The upload must be signed using OpenPGP-compatible software. All Debian developers have
            individual cryptographic key pairs. Developers are responsible for any package they upload even if the
            packaging was prepared by another contributor.

            <strong>Fedora or Fedora Linux</strong> is a Linux distribution developed by the community-supported Fedora
            Project which is sponsored primarily by Red Hat Inc. with minor support by other companies. Fedora contains
            software distributed under various free and open-source licenses and aims to be on the leading edge of free
            technologies.Fedora is the upstream source of the commercial Red Hat Enterprise Linux distribution.
            Since the release of Fedora 30, five different editions are currently available: Workstation, focused on the
            personal computer, Server for servers, CoreOS, focused on cloud computing, Silverblue, focused on an
            immutable desktop specialized to container-based workflows and IoT, focused on IoT devices.
            As of February 2016, Fedora has an estimated 1.2 million users, including Linus Torvalds (as of 2015),
            creator of the Linux kernel.
            Fedora is a trademark of Red Hat, Inc. Red Hat's application for trademark status for the name "Fedora" was
            disputed by Cornell University and the University of Virginia Library, creators of the unrelated Fedora
            Commons digital repository management software. The issue was resolved and the parties settled on a
            co-existence agreement that stated that the Cornell-UVA project could use the name when clearly associated
            with open source software for digital object repository systems and that Red Hat could use the name when it
            was clearly associated with open source computer operating systems.
          </p>

          <h3>Features</h3>
          <p>
            Fedora has a reputation for focusing on innovation, integrating new technologies early on and working
            closely with upstream Linux communities. Making changes upstream instead of specifically for Fedora ensures
            that the changes are available to all Linux distributions.
            Fedora has a relatively short life cycle: each version is usually supported for at least 13 months, where
            version X is supported only until 1 month after version X+2 is released and with approximately 6 months
            between most versions. Fedora users can upgrade from version to version without reinstalling.
            The default desktop environment in Fedora is GNOME and the default user interface is the GNOME Shell. Other
            desktop environments, including KDE Plasma, Xfce, LXDE, MATE, Deepin and Cinnamon, are available and can be
            installed.
          </p>

          <h3>Package management</h3>
          <p>
            Most Fedora editions use the RPM package management system, using DNF as a tool to manage the RPM packages.
            DNF uses libsolv, an external dependency resolver. Flatpak is also included by default, and support for
            Ubuntu's snaps can be added. Fedora uses Delta RPM when updating installed packages to provide delta
            updates. A Delta RPM contains the difference between an old and new version of a package. This means that
            only the changes between the installed package and the new one are downloaded, reducing network traffic and
            bandwidth consumption.
            The Fedora CoreOS and Silverblue editions use rpm-ostree, a hybrid transactional image/package system to
            manage the host. Traditional DNF (or other systems) should be used in containers.
          </p>

          <h3>Security</h3>
          <p>
            Fedora uses Security-Enhanced Linux by default, which implements a variety of security policies, including
            mandatory access controls, which Fedora adopted early on.Fedora provides a hardening wrapper, and does
            hardening for all of its packages by using compiler features such as position-independent executable (PIE).
          </p>

          <h3>Software</h3>
          <p>
            Fedora comes preinstalled with a wide range of software such as LibreOffice and Firefox. Additional software
            is available from the software repositories and can be installed using the DNF package manager or GNOME
            Software.
            Additionally, extra repositories can be added to the system, so that software not available in Fedora can be
            installed easily. Software that is not available via official Fedora repositories, either because it doesn't
            meet Fedora's definition of free software or because its distribution may violate US law, can be installed
            using third-party repositories. Popular third-party repositories include RPM Fusion free and non-free
            repositories. Fedora also provides users with an easy-to-use build system for creating their own
            repositories called Copr.
            Since the release of Fedora 25, the operating system defaults to the Wayland display server protocol, which
            replaced the X Window System.

        <article>
          <p>
            <strong>Arch Linux</strong> is a Linux distribution for computers based on x86-64 architectures. The Arch
            Linux repositories contain both libre, and nonfree software, and the default Arch Linux kernel contains
            nonfree proprietary blobs, hence the distribution is not endorsed by the GNU project.
            Arch Linux adheres to five principles: simplicity, modernity, pragmatism, user centrality and versatility.
            In general, the principles maintain minimal distribution-specific changes, minimal breakage with updates,
            pragmatic over ideological design choices, user-friendliness, and minimal bloat.
            A package manager written specifically for Arch Linux, Pacman, is used to install, remove and update
            software packages. Arch Linux uses a rolling release model, meaning there are no "major releases" of
            completely new versions of the system; a regular system update is all that is needed to obtain the latest
            Arch software; the installation images released by the Arch team are simply up-to-date snapshots of the main
            system components.
            Arch Linux has comprehensive documentation, which consists of a community wiki known as the ArchWiki.
            Inspired by CRUX, another minimalist distribution, Judd Vinet started the Arch Linux project in March 2002.
            The name was chosen because Vinet liked the word's meaning of "the principal," as in "arch-enemy".
            Originally only for 32-bit x86 CPUs, the first x86_64 installation ISO was released in April 2006.
            Vinet led Arch Linux until 1 October 2007, when he stepped down due to lack of time, transferring control of
            the project to Aaron Griffin.
            On 24 February 2020 Aaron Griffin transferred the control of the project to Levente Polyak.
            The end of i686 support was announced in January 2017, with the February 2017 ISO being the last one
            including i686 and making the architecture unsupported in November 2017. Since then, the community
            derivative Arch Linux 32 can be used for i686 hardware.
          </p>
          <h3>Design and principles</h3>
          <p>
            Arch is largely based on binary packages. Packages target x86-64 microprocessors to assist performance on
            modern hardware. A ports/ebuild-like system is also provided for automated source compilation, known as the
            Arch Build System.
            Arch Linux focuses on simplicity of design, meaning that the main focus involves creating an environment
            that is straightforward and relatively easy for the user to understand directly, rather than providing
            polished point-and-click style management tools — the package manager, for example, does not have an
            official graphical front-end. This is largely achieved by encouraging the use of succinctly commented, clean
            configuration files that are arranged for quick access and editing. This has earned it a reputation as a
            distribution for "intermediate and advanced Linux users who aren't afraid of the command line".
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Relying on complex tools to manage and build your system is going to hurt the end users. [...] "If you try
              to hide the complexity of the system, you'll end up with a more complex system". Layers of abstraction
              that serve to hide internals are never a good thing. Instead, the internals should be designed in a way
              such that they NEED no hiding.
            </p>
            <cite>— Aaron Griffin</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <h3>Installation</h3>
          <p>
            The Arch Linux website supplies ISO images that can be run from CD or USB. After a user partitions and
            formats their drive, a simple command line script (pacstrap) is used to install the base system. The
            installation of additional packages which are not part of the base system (for example, desktop
            environments), can be done with either pacstrap, or Pacman after booting (or chrooting) into the new
            installation.
            An alternative to using CD or USB images for installation is to use the static version of the package
            manager Pacman, from within another Linux-based operating system. The user can mount their newly formatted
            drive partition, and use pacstrap (or Pacman with the appropriate command-line switch) to install base and
            additional packages with the mountpoint of the destination device as the root for its operations. This
            method is useful when installing Arch Linux onto USB flash drives, or onto a temporarily mounted device
            which belongs to another system.
            Regardless of the selected installation type, further actions need to be taken before the new system is
            ready for use, most notably by installing a bootloader, creating an initramfs, and configuring the new
            system.
            Arch Linux does not schedule releases for specific dates but uses a "rolling release" system where new
            packages are provided throughout the day. Its package management allows users to easily keep systems
            updated.
            Occasionally, manual interventions are required for certain updates, with instructions posted on the news
            section of the Arch Linux website.

          <p>
            <strong>Ubuntu</strong> is a free and open-source Linux distribution based on Debian. Ubuntu is officially
            released in three editions: Desktop, Server, and Core for the internet of things devices and robots. All the
            editions can run on the computer alone, or in a virtual machine.[16] Ubuntu is a popular operating system
            for cloud computing, with support for OpenStack.
            Ubuntu is released every six months, with long-term support (LTS) releases every two years. The latest
            release is 19.10 ("Eoan Ermine"), and the most recent long-term support release is 18.04 LTS ("Bionic
            Beaver"), which is supported until 2023 under public support and until 2028 as a paid option.
            Ubuntu is developed by Canonical, and a community of other developers, under a meritocratic governance
            model.Canonical provides security updates and support for each Ubuntu release, starting from the release
            date and until the release reaches its designated end-of-life (EOL) date. Canonical generates revenue
            through the sale of premium services related to Ubuntu.
            Ubuntu is named after the African Nguni philosophy of ubuntu, which Canonical translates as "humanity to
            others" or "I am what I am because of who we all are".
          </p>
          <h3>Features</h3>
          <p>
            A default installation of Ubuntu contains a wide range of software that includes LibreOffice, Firefox,
            Thunderbird, Transmission, and several lightweight games such as Sudoku and chess. Many additional software
            packages are accessible from the built in Ubuntu Software (previously Ubuntu Software Center) as well as any
            other APT-based package management tools. Many additional software packages that are no longer installed by
            default, such as Evolution, GIMP, Pidgin, and Synaptic, are still accessible in the repositories still
            installable by the main tool or by any other APT-based package management tool. Cross-distribution snap
            packages and flatpaks are also available, that both allow installing software, such as some of Microsoft's
            software, in most of the major Linux operating systems (such as any currently supported Ubuntu version and
            in Fedora). The default file manager is GNOME Files, formerly called Nautilus.
            All of the application software installed by default is free software. In addition, Ubuntu redistributes
            some hardware drivers that are available only in binary format, but such packages are clearly marked in the
            restricted component.
          </p>
          <h3>Security</h3>
          <p>
            Ubuntu aims to be secure by default.[56][57] User programs run with low privileges and cannot corrupt the
            operating system or other users' files. For increased security, the sudo tool is used to assign temporary
            privileges for performing administrative tasks, which allows the root account to remain locked and helps
            prevent inexperienced users from inadvertently making catastrophic system changes or opening security
            holes.[58] Polkit is also being widely implemented into the desktop.
            Most network ports are closed by default to prevent hacking. A built-in firewall allows end-users who
            install network servers to control access. A GUI (GUI for Uncomplicated Firewall) is available to configure
            it. Ubuntu compiles its packages using GCC features such as PIE and buffer overflow protection to harden its
            software.These extra features greatly increase security at the performance expense of 1% in 32-bit and 0.01%
            in 64-bit.
            Ubuntu also supports full disk encryption as well as encryption of the home and Private directories.
          </p>
          <h3>Installation</h3>
          <p>
            The system requirements vary among Ubuntu products. For the Ubuntu desktop release 16.04 LTS, a PC with at
            least 2 GHz dual-core processor, 2 GB of RAM and 25 GB of free disk space is recommended. For less powerful
            computers, there are other Ubuntu distributions such as Lubuntu and Xubuntu. Ubuntu supports the ARM
            architecture. It is also available on Power ISA,while older PowerPC architecture was at one point
            unofficially supported, and now newer Power ISA CPUs (POWER8) are supported.
            Live images are the typical way for users to assess and subsequently install Ubuntu. These can be downloaded
            as a disk image (.iso) and subsequently burnt to a DVD and booted, or run via UNetbootin directly from a USB
            drive (making, respectively, a live DVD or live USB medium). Running Ubuntu in this way is slower than
            running it from a hard drive, but does not alter the computer unless specifically instructed by the user. If
            the user chooses to boot the live image rather than execute an installer at boot time, there is still the
            option to then use an installer called Ubiquity to install Ubuntu once booted into the live environment.
            Disk images of all current and past versions are available for download at the Ubuntu web site. Various
            third-party programs such as remastersys and Reconstructor are available to create customized copies of the
            Ubuntu Live DVDs (or CDs). "Minimal CDs" are available (for server use) that fit on a CD.

          <p>
            <strong>Kali Linux</strong> is a Debian-derived Linux distribution designed for digital forensics and
            penetration testing. It is maintained and funded by Offensive Security Ltd.
            Kali Linux has over 600 preinstalled penetration-testing programs, including Armitage (a graphical cyber
            attack management tool), Nmap (a port scanner), Wireshark (a packet analyzer), John the Ripper password
            cracker, Aircrack-ng (a software suite for penetration-testing wireless LANs), Burp suite and OWASP ZAP web
            application security scanners.
            It was developed by Mati Aharoni and Devon Kearns of Offensive Security through the rewrite of BackTrack,
            their previous information security testing Linux distribution based on Knoppix. The third core developer,
            Raphaël Hertzog, joined them as a Debian expert.
            Kali Linux is based on the Debian Testing branch. Most packages Kali uses are imported from the Debian
            repositories.
            The Kali Linux project began quietly in 2012, when Offensive Security decided that they wanted to replace
            their venerable BackTrack Linux project, which was manually maintained, with something that could become a
            genuine Debian derivative, complete with all of the required infrastructure and improved packaging
            techniques. The decision was made to build Kali on top of the Debian distribution because it is well known
            for its quality, stability, and wide selection of available software.
            The first version (1.0) was released one year later, in March 2013, and was based on Debian 7 “Wheezy”,
            Debian’s stable distribution at the time. In that first year of development, they packaged hundreds of
            pen-testing-related applications and built the infrastructure. Even though the number of applications is
            significant, the application list has been meticulously curated, dropping applications that no longer worked
            or that duplicated features already available in better programs.
            During the two years following version 1.0, Kali released many incremental updates, expanding the range of
            available applications and improving hardware support, thanks to newer kernel releases. With some investment
            in continuous integration, they ensured that all important packages were kept in an installable state and
            that customized live images (a hallmark of the distribution) could always be created.
            With version 2019.4 in November 2019, the default user interface was switched from GNOME to Xfce, with a
            GNOME version still available.
          </p>
          <h3>Supported platforms</h3>
          <p>
            Kali Linux is distributed in 32-bit and 64-bit images for use on hosts based on the x86 instruction set and
            as an image for the ARM architecture for use on the Beagle Board computer and on Samsung's ARM Chromebook.
            The developers of Kali Linux aim to make Kali Linux available for even more ARM devices.
            Kali Linux is already available for Asus Chromebook Flip C100P, BeagleBone Black, HP Chromebook, CubieBoard
            2, CuBox, CuBox-i, Raspberry Pi, EfikaMX, Odroid U2, Odroid XU, Odroid XU3, Samsung Chromebook, Utilite Pro,
            Galaxy Note 10.1, and SS808.
            With the arrival of Kali NetHunter, Kali Linux is also officially available on Android devices such as the
            Nexus 5, Nexus 6, Nexus 7, Nexus 9, Nexus 10, OnePlus One, and some Samsung Galaxy models.
            Kali Linux is available on Windows 10, on top of Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). The official Kali
            distribution for Windows can be downloaded from the Microsoft Store.
          </p>
          <h3>Features</h3>
          <p>
            Kali Linux has a dedicated project set aside for compatibility and porting to specific Android devices,
            called Kali Linux NetHunter.
            It is the first Open Source Android penetration testing platform for Nexus devices, created as a joint
            effort between the Kali community member "BinkyBear" and Offensive Security. It supports Wireless 802.11
            frame injection, one-click MANA Evil Access Point setups, HID keyboard (Teensy like attacks), as well as Bad
            USB MITM attacks.
            BackTrack (Kali's predecessor) contained a mode known as forensic mode, which was carried over to Kali via
            live boot. This mode is very popular for many reasons, partly because many Kali users already have a
            bootable Kali USB drive or CD, and this option makes it easy to apply Kali to a forensic job. When booted in
            forensic mode, the system doesn't touch the internal hard drive or swap space and auto mounting is disabled.
            However, the developers recommend that users test these features extensively before using Kali for real
            world forensics.
          </p>
          <h3>Requirements</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Kali Linux requires a minimum of 3GB hard disk space for installation.</li>
            <li>A minimum of 512MB RAM for i386 and AMD64 architectures.</li>

            The Linux command line is a text interface to your computer. Often referred to as the shell, terminal,
            console, prompt or various other names, it can give the appearance of being complex and confusing to use.
            Yet the ability to copy and paste commands from a website, combined with the power and flexibility the
            command line offers, means that using it may be essential when trying to follow instructions online
            Linux includes a large number of commands, but we’ve chosen 5 of the most important ones to present here.
            Learn these commands, and you’ll be much more at home at the Linux command prompt.
          </p>
          <h3>1. alias</h3>
          <p>
            The alias command lets you give your own name to a command or sequence of commands. You can then type your

            This sets up an alias called cls . It will be another name for clear . When you type cls, it will clear the
            screen just as though you had typed clear . Your alias saves a few keystrokes, sure. But, if you frequently
            move between Windows and Linux command line, you can find yourself typing the Windows cls command on a Linux
            machine that doesn’t know what you mean. Now it will know.

            Aliases can be much more intricate than that simple example. Here’s an alias called pf (for process find)
            that is just a little more complex. Note the use of quotation marks around the command sequence. This is
            required if the command sequence has spaces in it. This alias uses the ps command to list the running
            processes and then pipes them through the grep command. The grep command looks for entries in the output
            from ps that match the command line parameter $1 .
          </p>
          <code>alias pf="ps -e | grep $1"</code>
          <p>
            If you wanted to discover the process ID (PID) of the shutter process—or to find out if shutter was even
            running—you could use the alias like this. Type pf, a space, and the name of the process you are interested
            in:
          </p>
          <code>pf shutter</code>
          <p>
            Aliases defined on the command line will die with the terminal window. When you close it, they are gone. To
            make your aliases always be available to you, add them to the.bash_aliases file in your home directory.
          </p>

          <h3>2. cat</h3>
          <p>
            The cat command (short for “concatenate”) lists the contents of files to the terminal window. This is faster
            than opening the file in an editor, and there’s no chance you can accidentally alter the file. To read the
            contents of your .bash_log_out file, type the following command while the home directory is your current
            working directory, as it is by default:
          </p>
          <code>cat .bash_logout</code>
          <p>
            With files longer than the number of lines in your terminal window, the text will whip past too fast for you
            to read. You can pipe the output from cat through less to make the process more manageable. With less you
            can scroll forward and backward through the file using the Up and Down Arrow keys, the PgUp and PgDn keys,
            and the Home and End keys. Type q to quit from less.
          </p>
          <code>cat .bashrc | less</code>

          <h3>3. cd</h3>
          <p>
            The cd command changes your current directory. In other words, it moves you to a new place in the
            filesystem.
            If you are changing to a directory that is within your current directory, you can simply type cd and the
            name of the other directory.
          </p>
          <code>cd work</code>
          <p>
            If you are changing to a directory elsewhere within the filesystem directory tree, provide the path to the
            directory with a leading /.
          </p>
          <code>cd /usr/local/bin</code>
          <p>
            To quickly return to your home directory, use the ~ (tilde) character as the directory name.
          </p>
          <code>cd ~</code>
          <p>
            Here’s another trick: You can use the double dot symbol .. to represent the parent of the current directory.
            You can type the following command to go up a directory:
          </p>
          <code>cd ..</code>
          <p>
            Imagine you are in a directory. The parent directory has other directories in it, as well as the directory
            you’re currently in. To change into one of those other directories, you can use the .. symbol to shorten
            what you have to type.
          </p>
          <code>cd ../games</code>

          <h3>4. chmod</h3>
          <p>
            The chmod command sets the file permissions flags on a file or folder. The flags define who can read, write
            to or execute the file. When you list files with the -l (long format) option you’ll see a string of
            characters that look like
          </p>
          <code>-rwxrwxrwx</code>
          <p>
            If the first character is a - the item is a file, if it is a d the item is a directory. The rest of the
            string is three sets of three characters. From the left, the first three represent the file permissions of
            the owner, the middle three represent the file permissions of the group and the rightmost three characters
            represent the permissions for others. In each set, an r stands for read, a w stands for write, and an x
            stands for execute.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the <small>r, w, </small>or <small>x</small> character is present that file permission is granted. If the
            letter is not present and a - appears instead, that file permission is not granted.
          </p>
          <p>
            One way to use chmod is to provide the permissions you wish to give to the owner, group, and others as a 3
            digit number. The leftmost digit represents the owner. The middle digit represents the group. The rightmost
            digit represents the others. The digits you can use and what they represent are listed here:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>0: No permission</li>
            <li>1: Execute permission</li>
            <li>2: Write permission</li>
            <li>3: Write and execute permissions</li>
            <li>4: Read permission</li>
            <li>5: Read and execute permissions</li>
            <li>6: Read and write permissions</li>
            <li>7: Read, write and execute permissions</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Looking at our example.txt file, we can see that all three sets of characters are rwx. That means everyone
            has read, write and execute rights with the file.To set the permission to be read, write, and execute (7
            from our list) for the owner; read and write (6 from our list) for the group; and read and execute (5 from
            our list) for the others we’d need to use the digits 765 with the chmod command:
          </p>
          <code>chmod -R 765 example.txt</code>
          <p>
            To set the permission to be read, write and execute (7 from our list) for the owner, and read and write (6
            from our list) for the group and for the others we’d need to use the digits 766 with the chmod command:
          </p>
          <code>chmod 766 example.txt</code>

          <h3>5. chown</h3>
          <p>
            The chown command allows you to change the owner and group owner of a file. Listing our example.txt file
            with ls -l we can see dave dave in the file description. The first of these indicates the name of the file
            owner, which in this case is the user dave. The second entry shows that the name of the group owner is also
            dave. Each user has a default group created when the user is created. That user is the only member of that
            group. This shows that the file is not shared with any other groups of users.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can use chown to change the owner or group, or both of a file. You must provide the name of the owner
            and the group, separated by a : character. You will need to use sudo. To retain dave as the owner of the
            file but to set mary as the group owner, use this command:
          </p>
          <code>sudo chown dave:mary example.txt</code>
          <p>
            To change both the owner and the group owner to mary, you would use the following command;
          </p>
          <code>sudo chown mary:mary example.txt</code>
          <p>
            To change the file so that dave is once more the file owner and the group owner, use this command:
          </p>
          <code>sudo chown dave:dave example.txt</code>

            Learning Linux is like learning anything else. You’re going to need some practice before become familiar
            with these commands. Once you have these commands at your fingertips, you’ll be well along the path to
            proficiency.

            There’s an old joke—probably as old as Unix itself—that says the only command you need to know is the man
            command. There’s a glimmer of truth in that, but some of the man pages are impenetrable without an
            introduction. This tutorial should give you the introduction you need.
